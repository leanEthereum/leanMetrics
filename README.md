# Lean Ethereum Metrics Specifications

This repository tracks and standardizes metrics for the Lean Ethereum Consensus clients, with a focus on Prometheus-compatible metrics to monitor protocol performance, network health, and upgrade readiness. Metrics are essential for client teams to ensure interoperability, facilitate testing, identify bottlenecks, and support research into early implementations.

## Client Teams Guide

To contribute to metric standardization and tracking:

- **Review and/or Propose**: Review the proposed metrics in the relevant files and/or submit proposed metrics.
- **Implement Standardized Metrics**: Implement the metrics in your client codebase, ensuring they align with the standardized names, types, and units.
- **Track Implementation**: Open a tracking issue in your client's repository to monitor implementation progress.
- **Update Implementation Status**: Update the implementation status in the relevant metrics files in this repository via a PR (e.g., change status to ✅ implemented, 📝 in progress, or □ not implemented). Client teams are encouraged to open these PRs directly as progress is made.
